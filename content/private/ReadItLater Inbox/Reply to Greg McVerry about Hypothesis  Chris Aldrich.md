> @chrisaldrich Wouldn’t it be neat if @hypothesis was also a micropub client or used the API so I could PESOS each annotation to my blog as a quote post-kind? So cool @xolotl is coming coming to [#indieweb](https://boffosocko.com/tag/indieweb/) summit. Know the markup doesn’t match but that ain’t a hard fix. Has to be somefun ways regardless of tech to make wordpress and open annotation talk.

There is the (abandoned?) [Hypothesis Aggregator plugin](https://github.com/kshaffer/hypothesis_aggregator)  which Nate has worked on a bit that allows a relatively easy [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) workflow from [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to WordPress, but you’re right that it would be nice to have a micropub version that would work for all CMSs.

Personally, I’d also love them to support Webmention which I think would be generally useful as well. There are obvious use cases for it in addition to an anti-abuse one which [I’ve written about before](https://boffosocko.com/2016/04/07/webmentions-for-improving-annotation-and-preventing-bullying-on-the-web/). Perhaps if it were supported and had better anti-troll or [NIPSA](https://indieweb.org/NIPSA) (Not In Public Site Areas) features folks like [Audrey Watters might not block it](https://boffosocko.com/2017/05/10/un-annotated-by-audrey-watters/).
