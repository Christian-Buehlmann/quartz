> ‚ÄúGiving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web.‚Äù

Not sure how this surfaced into my feeds again today, but interesting to see it pop up. I‚Äôm also noticing that Audrey smartly [posted a copy to her own site](http://hackeducation.com/2015/10/19/domains) after it appeared in Bright.

In this article, she touches on some reasons why it‚Äôs important for students to have their own domain, but many of these ideas and arguments also work well for almost anyone. It‚Äôs interesting to see how similar the philosophy she describes here dovetails with that of the IndieWeb.
