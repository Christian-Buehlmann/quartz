## What is Connected Learning?

Connected learning combines personal interests, supportive relationships, and opportunities. It is learning in an age of abundant access to information and social connection that embraces the diverse backgrounds and interests of all young people.

## Elements of Connected Learning

The research is clear: Learning is irresistible and life-changing when it connects personal interests to meaningful relationships and real-world opportunity.

### Interests

Learning is motivating when it grows out of personal interest. [A growing body of research](https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/11/04/how-the-power-of-interest-drives-learning/) indicates that interest helps us pay attention, make connections, persist and engage in deeper learning. For [example](https://wcer.wisc.edu/docs/working-papers/Working_Paper_No_2011_03.pdf), when reading about games they enjoy playing, teenage boys read at a much higher level than their reading level in school.

### Relationships

Learners need support from peers and mentors to persist through setbacks and challenges. A [survey](https://products.gallup.com/168857/gallup-purdue-index-inaugural-national-report.aspx) of 30,000 college graduates found that a strong connection to a faculty member doubled the positive life outcomes of graduates.

### Opportunities

Success beyond the classroom requires tangible connections to real-world career and civic opportunities. [The Digital Youth Network](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/digital-youth-network) provided in- and out-of-school connected learning experiences to low-income students in Chicago. They surpassed their more wealthier peers, growing up in Silicon Valley, in 21st-century competencies and digital media engagement.

## Spotlight: YOUmedia Chicago

YOUmedia, a youth digital makerspace in Chicago’s main downtown public library, embodies the values and elements of connected learning.

YOUmedia centers on digital media production such as music, art, poetry and journalism. Young people can “hang out socially, mess around with new projects and geek out” in areas of specialization when they want to take the leap. Librarians and mentors organize showcases, support the production of various projects and broker connections to other opportunities in their interest area.

Youth who participated at YOUmedia saw clear results.

-   Feeling emotionally and physically safe and a sense of belonging
-   Becoming more involved in the chosen interests they brought to YOUmedia
-   Improving in at least one digital media skill
-   Improving academic skills: better communication with adults and improved writing ability
-   Understanding more about opportunities available to them after high school

## Elements of Connected Learning Environments

Connected learning does not rely on a single technology or technique. Rather, it is fostered over time through a combination of supports for developing interests, relationships, skills, and a sense of purpose.

### Sponsorship of Youth Interests

Organizations and adults must meet youth where they are in order to foster connected learning. They do this by being sponsors of what youth are genuinely interested in — recognizing diverse interests and providing mentorship, space, and other resources.

### Shared Practices

Ongoing shared activities are the backbone of connected learning. Through collaborative production, friendly competition, civic action, and joint research, youth and adults make things, have fun, learn, and make a difference together.

### Shared Purpose

Learners need to feel a sense of belonging and be able to make meaningful contributions to a community in order to experience connected learning. Groups that foster connected learning have shared culture and values, are welcoming to newcomers, and encourage sharing, feedback and learning among all participants.

### Connections Across Settings

As connected learners develop, they access varied programs, communities and opportunities. In order to support diverse learner pathways, organizations and caring adults can form partnerships, broker connections across settings, and share on openly networked platforms and portfolios.

## Our Impact

Educators have been putting connected learning into practice through a wide range of networks and organizations, in both formal and informal environments.

### Educator Networks

The National Writing Project, Young Adult Library Services Association and the Consortium for School Networking have embraced the connected learning framework. Click [\[here\]](https://clalliance.org/connected-learning-in-teaching-practice/) to learn more about connected learning in teaching practice.
