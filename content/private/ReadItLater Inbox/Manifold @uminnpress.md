## [Electronic Mediations](https://manifold.umn.edu/journals/electronic-mediations)

Electronically mediated communication has established lasting and significant changes in society and culture, politics and economics, thinking and being. From the development, adoption, and now international ubiquity of the Internet to virtual reality technologies, the mainstream popularity of video games, the genre of literary hypertexts, and a proliferation of digital art and other new media art forms, technology has infused everyday life and all aspects of our interaction, communication, and expression. The books in this series explore the humanistic and social implications of these new technologies.
