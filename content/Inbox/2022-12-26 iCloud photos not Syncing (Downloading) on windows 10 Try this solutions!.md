## iCloud photos not downloading to pc

Also if you notice iCloud photos not downloading to pc on windows 10, try solutions below.

And Make sure that both iCloud Photo Library and Download New Photos and Videos to My PC are enabled.

### Enable my photostream

If you’ve got certain iOS devices with just My Photo Stream enabled, iCloud Photos won’t download newer photos from such devices unless your PC also has its own photostream turned on. To enable the feature, simply head over to the Photos Options pane again, and then check the box next to My Photo Stream. Once done, click Done to save the changes.

You need to remember that with My Photo Stream, only photos, and not videos, are synced between devices. Also, the photostream should appear directly under the Downloads folder — instead of sub-folders by year — once you access iCloud Photos.

### Restart iCloud Processes
