> As a member of the [IndieWeb movement/community](https://indieweb.org/), I follow many of their [principles](http://indiewebcamp.com/principles "IndieWebCamp principles") including [owning all of my own data](https://indieweb.org/own_your_data) by publishing it on my own website. When I participate on most social media sites, I generally post here first and syndicate/cross-post duplicates out to them ([POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE "POSSE (Post on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)")). In some cases, I may post to social services first and then immediately syndicate copies of that content to my own website ([PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS "PESOS(Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site)")).
