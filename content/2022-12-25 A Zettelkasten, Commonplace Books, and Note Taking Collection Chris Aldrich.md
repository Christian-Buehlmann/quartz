Below I’ve aggregated a list of some of the longer articles and material I’ve written about these topics. The completist can find and search my site for even more specific material with these tags: [zettelkasten](https://boffosocko.com/tag/zettelkasten/), [commonplace books](https://boffosocko.com/tag/commonplace-books/), and [note taking](https://boffosocko.com/category/note-taking/). I’ve also contributed a fair amount to the Wikipedia pages for [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) and [commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).
