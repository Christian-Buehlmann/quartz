> Hi Friend! 
> Welcome to asuth.com. I built this website so you can get to know me a bit.
> I’m in a goofy and exploratory phase of my life. I am indulging my curiosity, saying yes to adventures, and finding projects that bring me joy and keep me up late into the night. 
> Previously, I founded Quizlet, an educational software company serving millions of students and teachers worldwide. After working on Quizlet from age 15 to age 30, I left the company in 2020.
