title: "2022-12-17 My Obsidian People Note Template"
---


> I recently shared the [](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template)template that I created for my Daily Notes, and many people found it useful. As a follow up, I wanted to share how I manage _people_ in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) universe.

> For me, the most common use-case for People entries in Obsidian is for meeting notes. I add an attendee list to every meeting note I take, with each name linking to a page that’s been populated with the People Template I share here.

> A useful People page should contain the following information:
>  -  At-a-glance information about _who_ a person is
>  - _How_ to contact them
>  - Additional notes (maybe a fun fact?)
>  -  List of all meetings we’ve attended together

> In this post, I’ll first walk you through the template itself, and then share how I use it in my day-to-day note taking.
